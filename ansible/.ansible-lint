  # pause/resume operations continue even if individual steps fail
  - ignore-errors  # runbooks need to continue on failure
  - no-changed-when  # shell commands in runbooks are idempotent by nature
  - run-once  # runbooks use run_once for validation tasks
  - syntax-check[unknown-module]  # archive module may not be installed in lint env

# Warn but don't fail on these
warn_list:
  - experimental
