# Ansible Lint Configuration
# https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/configuring/

# Skip rules that conflict with emergency runbook patterns
skip_list:
  # Emergency runbooks intentionally use ignore_errors to ensure
  # pause/resume operations continue even if individual steps fail
  - ignore-errors  # runbooks need to continue on failure
  - no-changed-when  # shell commands in runbooks are idempotent by nature
  - run-once  # runbooks use run_once for validation tasks

# Warn but don't fail on these
warn_list:
  - experimental

# Exclude problematic runbook files from syntax-check
# These files use dynamic hosts that can't be validated statically
exclude_paths:
  - .github/
  - runbooks/remove-region.yml  # uses ansible.builtin.archive not in CI env
